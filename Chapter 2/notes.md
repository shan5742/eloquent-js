# Program Structure

This chapter is all about taking JS one step further than the basic values and operators. It shows us what statements and expressions are and introduces us to some fundamental keywords in javascript like variables, functions, loops as well as some vital information about adding comments and proper names to aid readability.

Putting statements after one another gives you a program that is executed from top to bottom. You can introduce disturbances in the flow of control by using conditional (if, else, and switch) and looping (while, do, and for) statements.

Bindings are used to store pieces of information for easy access later on in your program.

Please see the chapter 2 exercises section for some examples.
