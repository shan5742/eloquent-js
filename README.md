# eloquent-js

A repo for me to make notes and do projects/challenges as I work through the **Eloquent Javascript** book.

## Chapter 1

#### Values, Types, and Operators

Chapter 1 looks at four types of JavaScript values in this chapter: numbers, strings, Booleans, and undefined values.

Such values are created by typing in their name (true, null) or value (13, "abc"). You can combine and transform values with operators. We saw binary operators for arithmetic (+, -, \*, /, and %), string concatenation (+), comparison (==, !=, ===, !==, <, >, <=, >=), and logic (&&, ||), as well as several unary operators (- to negate a number, ! to negate logically, and typeof to find a valueâ€™s type) and a ternary operator (?:) to pick one of two values based on a third value.

The above is a little intro to the book with a copy/paste of chapter 1 summary, those of you who haven't should definitely check it out [here](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).

From now on I will organise the repo into the different chapters with some notes and files for the exercises.
