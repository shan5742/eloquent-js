## Looping a triangle

Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

```
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```

It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.

```javascript
let abc = "abc";
console.log(abc.length);
// → 3
```

Most exercises contain a piece of code that you can modify to solve the exercise. Remember that you can click code blocks to edit them.

### Solution

```js
for (let solution = "#"; solution.length < 8; solution += "#")
  console.log(solution);
```

## FizzBuzz

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

(This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, your labor market value just went up.)

### Solution

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  let result = "";
  if (i % 3 == 0) result += "Fizz";
  if (i % 5 == 0) result += "Buzz";
  console.log(result || i);
}
```

## Chessboard

Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

```
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
```

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.

### Solution

```js
let size = 8;

let board = "";

for (let y = 0; y < size; y++) {
  for (let x = 0; x < size; x++) {
    if ((x + y) % 2 == 0) {
      board += " ";
    } else {
      board += "#";
    }
  }
  board += "\n";
}

console.log(board);
```
